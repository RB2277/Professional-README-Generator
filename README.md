## Description

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This app is used to generate a professional README by using node within the console. Using the node package "Inquirer", you are asked a series of prompts related to filling out a README file. Once this is done, the node fs module is used to write a new README.md file called "newREADME.md"
